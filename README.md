This app uses data downloaded from IMDb's [Plain Text Data Files](http://www.imdb.com/interfaces) to plot user ratings from all episodes of a selected TV series.  The plot can be used to tell at a glance if a series gets better or worse over time. Use it to determine if a series is worth watching before buying DVDs or investing time on Netflix.
